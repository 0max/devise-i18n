## (Next version)

- Code and translations from [devise-i18n-views](https://github.com/mcasimir/devise-i18n-views) has been merged into devise-i18n. This means that devise-i18n will now also include i18n for the views that devise provides. You will no longer need devise-i18n-views going forward.
- Added a new string from devise (the subject line from the password changed email).
- Numerous new and updated translations.
